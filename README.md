# Statistical Timeline: From Classical Statistics to Modern AI

This project presents an interactive timeline highlighting key milestones in the history of statistics, tracing its evolution from foundational figures like **De Moivre** and **Bayes** to modern developments in **artificial intelligence** and **deep learning**.

The visualization was developed in **RStudio** using the [`r2d3`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/r2d3/index.html) package, which enables the integration of D3.js graphics into R.  

**Live demo:** [View timeline on RPubs](https://rpubs.com/hllinas/R_Multivariado_Historia)
