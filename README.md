# STATISTICAL TIMELINE 
## From Classical Statistics to Modern AI

**Updated:** June 22, 2025

This project presents an interactive timeline highlighting key milestones in the history of statistics, tracing its evolution from foundational figures like **De Moivre** and **Bayes** to modern developments in **artificial intelligence** and **deep learning**.

The visualization was developed in **RStudio** using the [`r2d3`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/r2d3/index.html) package, which enables the integration of D3.js graphics into R.

### Live demo

The timeline can be viewed at [this RPubs link](https://rpubs.com/hllinas/R_Stat_to_AI_Timeline), which serves as the main visualization. An applied version is also available in [another set of lecture notes](https://rpubs.com/hllinas/R_Multivariado_Historia).

An example of how the timeline looks (without interactivity) is shown in the image below:

### Project Files

This repository includes all relevant files used to build the timeline:

- `Historia.Rmd` – R Markdown file with the full timeline script
- `Historia.html` – Interactive timeline in HTML format, generated from the R Markdown file
- `script.js` – JavaScript code used in the `r2d3` visualization  
- `DataBase.xlsx` – Excel file containing the historical data
- `Timeline1.png` – Static image preview of the timeline (non-interactive version)  

> When you hover the mouse pointer over the tip of each arrow, a tooltip displays the description of the historical event, as specified in the Excel file.
